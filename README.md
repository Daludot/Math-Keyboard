# Math-Keyboard
This repository contains files required to build a math keyboard of my own design.

The legends .svg file follows the instructions of the WASDKeyboards template. This file is submitted with the keycap order when prompted. The KBD67
has two 1.25u modifiers right of the spacebar instead of the four 1u keys in the template. This should be explained in the comments section of the order so that 
WASD provides the correct keys.

Feel free to modify these legends for different preferences or layouts.

The keymap file does not currently have any function keys. This can be added as another layer. The four keys in the far right column are meant to be
configured a variety of ways. For keyboards other than the KBD67, the rules and config files should probably be replaced with equivalent rules and config
files from the QMK repo.
